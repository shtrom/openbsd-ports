Fail2Ban scans log files like /var/log/pwdfail and bans IP that makes
too many password failures. It updates firewall rules to reject the IP
address. These rules can be defined by the user. Fail2Ban can read
multiple log files such as sshd or Apache web server ones.

Fail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of incorrect authentications
attempts however it cannot eliminate the risk that weak authentication
presents. Configure services to use only two factor or public/private
authentication mechanisms if you really want to protect services.
