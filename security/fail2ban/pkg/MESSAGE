Fail2ban can be configured in /etc/fail2ban/. The most interesting
settings are in jail.conf; look for the following parameters.
* ignoreip,
* destemail,
* sender,
* action (select one of the action_* define before it).

To enable more than the basic monitoring of ssh logs, copy the relevant
(commented-out) section from /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf to a specific file in

    /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/${SERVICE}.local

For the drops to be effective, the following PF rules needs to be added
towards the top of /etc/pfctl.conf.

    table <fail2ban>
    block drop in quick on egress from <fail2ban>
