An example configuration file as at ${INSTDIR}/paste.ini. You need to
copy it to /etc/mediagoblin.paste.ini,

    sudo cp ${INSTDIR}/paste.ini /etc/mediagoblin.paste.ini

and adjust it to your needs, before you start the rc script in
/etr/rc.d/mediagoblin. By default, a separate celery server will be
started.

By default, an SQLite3 backend is uses, but can alternatively use
PostgreSQL (databases/pastgresql,-server). Additional dependencies are
needed in this case:
 * databases/pastgresql,-client
 * databases/py-psycopg2

An example Nginx configuration is also available at
${INSTDIR}/nginx.mediagoblin.conf.
