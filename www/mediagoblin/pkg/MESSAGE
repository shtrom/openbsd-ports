An example configuration file as at ${SYSCONFDIR}/paste.ini. You need to
adjust it to your needs. If you don't see what you need there, have a
look at ${TRUEPREFIX}mediagoblin/config_spec.ini You can then start the
rc script in /etr/rc.d/mediagoblin.*, or adding "mediagoblin_celery
ediagoblin_paste" to the pkg_scripts variable in
${SYSCONFDIR}/rc.conf.local. By default, a separate celery server will
be started.

You might want to set-up logrotation by adding the following lines to
${SYSCONFDIR}/newsyslog.conf
    /var/log/mediagoblin.log _mediagoblin:_mediagoblin        644  9 10000 *     Z "/etc/rc.d/mediagoblin restart > /dev/null"
    /var/log/mediagoblin.celery.log _mediagoblin:_mediagoblin        644  9 10000 *     Z "/etc/rc.d/mediagoblin restart > /dev/null"

By default, an SQLite3 backend is used, but can alternatively be
replaced by PostgreSQL (databases/postgresql,-server). Additional
dependencies are needed in this case:
 * databases/pastgresql,-client
 * databases/py-psycopg2

An example Nginx configuration is also available at
${SYSCONFDIR}/nginx.mediagoblin.conf.
