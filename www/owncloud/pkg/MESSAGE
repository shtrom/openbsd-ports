To enable owncloud please create a symbolic link from
 ${PREFIX}/conf/modules.sample/owncloud.conf
to ${PREFIX}/conf/modules/owncloud.conf.

ln -s ../modules.sample/owncloud.conf ${PREFIX}/conf/modules

You'll need to enable mod_rewrite in ${PREFIX}/conf/httpd.conf. Then,
can restart apache and point your browser to http://yourhost/owncloud/
to set up this instance.

The appstore is disabled by default in ${PREFIX}/owncloud/config.php.
You can reactivate it by changing "appstoreenabled" to true, and giving
write permissions to group www on ${PREFIX}/owncloud/apps.

perl -pi -e 's/"appstoreenabled" =>.*/"appstoreenabled" => true,/' \
	${PREFIX}/owncloud/config/config.php
chmod -R g+w ${PREFIX}/owncloud/apps/

This package is configured to run out of a chroot in ${PREFIX} by
default.  You might need to changes paths in
${PREFIX}/conf/modules/owncloud.conf and ${PREFIX}/owncloud/config.php
if you want to run it otherwise (not recommended).
