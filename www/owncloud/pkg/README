| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

ownCloud is installed under
    ${INSTDIR}

Post-installation instructions
==============================
With Apache, AllowOverride settings are required on the ${INSTDIR}
directory. You can configure this as follows:
    # ln -sf /var/www/conf/modules.sample/owncloud.conf /var/www/conf/modules

"allow_url_fopen" needs to be enabled in PHP using _one_ of the
following methods:
    1. ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-${MODPHP_VERSION}.ini
    allow_url_fopen = On
    2. /var/www/conf/httpd.conf (main server or VirtualHost)
    php_admin_value allow_url_fopen 1

The maximum upload size for files can be modified in
    ${INSTDIR}/.htaccess

When not using Apache, make _sure_ to set the data directory to a
location outside of the document root.

ownCloud attempts to use the UTF-8 locale, which does not work inside
the /var/www chroot by default. This causes warning messages in
ownCloud's admin configuration page and log. To prevent this problem,
run the following as root:
  # mkdir -p /var/www/usr/share/locale/en_US.UTF-8/
  # cp /usr/share/locale/en_US.UTF-8/LC_CTYPE \
          /var/www/usr/share/locale/en_US.UTF-8/

To finish the installation, point your browser to:
    http://<hostname>/owncloud/

Database Configuration
----------------------
ownCloud can work with a PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite3 database.
Support for SQLite3 is included with the main php package; to use
another database, the corresponding package needs to be installed:
    php-pdo_pgsql or php-pdo_mysql

When using SQLite, not further configuration is required. However, with
MySQL or PostgreSQL, the file ${INSTDIR}/config/config.sample.php will
need to be copied to ${INSTDIR}/config/config.php and configured
accordingly.

Cron job
--------
If "backgroundjobs" is configured to "Cron" (as opposed to "AJAX" or
"Webcron") in the Admin menu, a cron(8) job must be added to the root's
crontab(5):

*/5	*	*	*	*	${MODPHP_BIN} ${INSTDIR}/cron.php

LDAP User Backend
-----------------
If the LDAP user backend is enabled, the "php-ldap" package will need to
be installed.

Finishing and validating the installation
-----------------------------------------
Accessing http://<hostname>/owncloud with a Web browser will finish the
installation and create a new admin user.

Updating
========
Before updating to a new release, read:
    http://owncloud.org/support/upgrade/

When using a PostgreSQL or MySQL, the corresponding MDB2 php package
must be installed to properly upgrade the database:
    php-pgsql or php-mysql

WebDAV access
=============
The personnal WebDAV share can be accessed using the following URL (e.g.
with Nautilus, Thunar or Doplhin) and the corresponding user and
password for the share:
    http://<hostname>/owncloud/remote.php/webdav/

NOTE that it is highly recommended to use SSL on the webserver so that
access is done over https instead of http.

Synchronization
===============
The "ocsync" package (net/ocsync) can be installed to synchronize local
files with ownCloud. e.g.
    $ ocsync /path/to/localdir ownclouds://<username>:<password>@<hostname>/files/webdav.php/remotedir/

Apps and dependencies
=====================
To keep dependencies to a minimum, not all dependencies for all
installed apps are enforced. It is the job of the administrator to
manually install required packages according to the non-default apps he
wants to enable.
