| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The WordPress has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../wordpress /var/www/htdocs/wordpress
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

and proceed to complete the installation by reading:
${INSTDIR}/readme.html

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/wordpress/
