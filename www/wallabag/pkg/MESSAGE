This software require to have short tags enabled, check your
/etc/php-${MODPHP_VERSION}.ini => "short_open_tag = On"

Once installed and configured (from the web interface), or after upgrading you
will have to move the install folder out of the way:

  mv ${INSTDIR}/install ${INSTDIR}/install-${V}

You might also need packages php-pdo_mysql or php-pdo_pgsql if you want to use
these backends instead of SQLite3.
