Repositories to be browsed must be specified in
${INSTDIR}/include/config.php so WebSVN knows how to access them. The
two simplest ways to specify repositories are to use:

    $config->addRepository(...) to add repositories one-by-one, or
    $config->parentPath(...) to add a directory full of repositories at once.

If WebSVN must supply a username and password to access a remote
repository, you can supply these arguments in the
$config->addRepository(...) call for that repository

WebSVN allows you to group repositories logically if desired.When groups
exist, using $config->useTreeIndex() will create a hierarchical index
page with collapsible/expandable group sections.

SECURITY NOTE: WebSVN won't work in a chroot, due to the need to call the svn
and svnlook commands.
